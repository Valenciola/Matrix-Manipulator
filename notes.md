# Notes (in other words, planned features)

## Basics
- Switching between different function groups
- Logistics/Stats/Something (determinant, classifications)
- Operations (scalar, dot product, addition)
- Manipulation (elementary row)

### Matrix Generation
- Making each cell of the matrix able to take a typed-in value (lock/unlock editing)

### Matrix Manipulation
- Elementary row equations (scalars and whatnot)
- Queue to show process (do undo and redo features?)

### Matrix Equations
- Being able to multiply matrices or vectors (dot product)
- Vectors and scalars

### Additional Features
- Alerting whether a matrix is consistent or inconsistent, or in RREF (for aesthetics), or is the identity matrix
- Find the determinant
- Adding more than one matrix :D

### Aesthetic
- Make the table square
- Make form input more visually pleasing
