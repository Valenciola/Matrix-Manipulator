### Matrix Generation
- Making each cell of the matrix able to take a typed-in value (lock/unlock editing)

### Matrix Manipulation

- Queue to show process (do undo and redo features?)

### Matrix Equations
- Being able to multiply matrices or vectors (dot product)
- Vectors and scalars

## Additional Features
- Alerting whether a matrix is consistent or inconsistent, or in RREF (for aesthetics)
- Find the determinant

## Aesthetic
- Make the table square
