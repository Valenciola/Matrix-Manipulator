# Notes

## Basics
### Matrix Generation
- Being able to create a matrix of dimensions m x n (so use buttons to extend or shrink; how to do this with arrays in JS?)
- Making each cell of the matrix able to take a typed-in value

### Matrix Manipulation
- Elementary row equations (scalars and whatnot)
- Queue to show process (do undo and redo features?)

### Matrix Equations
- Being able to multiply matrices or vectors (dot product)
- Vectors and scalars

## Additional Features
- Alerting whether a matrix is consistent or inconsistent, or in RREF (for aesthetics)
